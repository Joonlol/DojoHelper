> A: Yes! Click this link to view a preview of the mod and all supported modes: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/FmI1B04Hnfs)

- Q: Is this mod Safe to use?
> A: Yes! This mod is entirely safe to use as this is a mere helper and aims to replicate regular human interactions

- Q: Can I use this on any computer/account/network?
> A: Yes! This mod is not license based as it is entirely free to use, so you can use this on any Windows, MacOS, Linux, Ethernet/WiFi and Minecraft account as you wish.

- Q: What ping is this for?
> A: Any ping! If you have low ping but are simply struggling with the dojo you can use this mod as well!

- Q: What's the maximum amount of points I can get from this?
> A: As much as you'd like! You control when the mod stops, so point gain can be infinite!

- Q: Do you plan on extending the modules to support more Dojo modes?
> A: Yes I do, but currently due to AI limitations I can only do these modules. These services tend to be very resource dependent and I want to try as hard as possible to keep the mod entirely free, forever.

> A: Yes! You can use this to safely get all 7000 points required for the black belt.
